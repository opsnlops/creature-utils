# Joystick-driven DMX-like sender

This application uses any joystick that Linux supports to send a DMX-like byte array down the wire via a UART, to a listening controller.

It's a prototyping feature, to allow me to use any joystick I want to send events to program (and test) creatures as I work on them. :)

I own a lot of joysticks. Right now the DS4 is my current favorite (I have several), but I'm always looking for a new favorite.
