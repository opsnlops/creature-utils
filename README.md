# Creature Utils for Linux Computers

This is my collection of utilities for Creatures. My goal is to write it in portable C that can compile on a lot of different platforms, as long as they run Linux. (Mostly Raspberry Pis and normal Debian Linux.)


## Joystick

Opens joysticks (can open more than one to get a lot of channels) and uses it to send E1.31 packets with control frames.

This is what I use for testing and programming Creatures.
